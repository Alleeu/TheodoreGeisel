In conclusion Theodor Geisel proved himself as a competent writer in multiple different styles.  
Although he is best known for his childrenâ€™s books such as Cat in the Hat and Green Eggs and Ham 
his political cartoons and work directly toward the war effort showed his versatility as a writer.  
His works have passed the test of time and are still relevant today even after 60 years.
